1) RDS -- Relational Database Services. 
2) In general there are 3 types of Databases such are relational, non relational and 
semi relational 
3) Relational DBs --> SQL detabases or structured.
4) DB Cluster --> Usually for HA we build one master and multiple stand by DBs. Master 
is a read and write DB. Stand bys are read only. In case if master DB goes down processes 
shouldn't be interrupted. One of the stand by DB will become read/write DB (Master). And RDS will 
spin up one more stand by read only DB. 
5) DB instance class --> Memory optimized classes (includes r classes) and Burstable classes (includes t classes)
6) Memory optimized classes --> Memory optimized instances accelerate performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory. 
7) Burstable classes --> Burstable performance instances provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline.
8) Subnet Group --> In order to put DB in private subnets we create Subnet Group from Private Subnets only. 
9) No matter what we always need a Reader/Writer DB instance. If Reader/Writer DB instance goes down
Reader instance will become Reader/Writer DB instance.
